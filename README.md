# Report on Refactoring the Python Bank Project

## Introduction:
The Python bank project was initially developed with the aim of creating a simple bank account management system. However, during the development process, the need for refactoring the code to improve its readability, modularity, and efficiency was identified. This report describes the process of refactoring the project, including the methods used, the results obtained, and a conclusion on the benefits of refactoring.

## Methods:
1. **Utilization of Classes:**
   - One of the main improvements made during refactoring was the introduction of classes to represent clients and bank accounts. This helped better organize the code, encapsulate related data and behaviors, and facilitate the extensibility of the system.

2. **Separation of Responsibilities:**
   - Functionalities related to creating clients and bank accounts were separated into specific functions (`create_client()` and `create_account()`), following the single responsibility principle. This made the code more modular and easier to understand.

3. **Improvement of the Options Menu:**
   - The system's options menu was enhanced to provide a more intuitive user experience. Each option was clearly defined and associated with a specific function, simplifying interaction with the system.

## Case Study:
To illustrate the effectiveness of the refactoring, consider the case of a user wanting to create a new bank account. Before refactoring, the account creation process involved confusing and unstructured interactions with the user. However, after refactoring, the user can easily follow a clear and simple workflow by selecting the "New Account" option in the main menu and providing the necessary information.

## Results:
The main results of the refactoring include:
- More readable and organized code.
- Better modularity and code reuse.
- Improved user experience.
- Ease of maintenance and extension of the system.

## Conclusion:
The refactoring of the Python bank project resulted in significant improvements, both in terms of code and usability. The introduction of classes, the separation of responsibilities, and the improvement of the options menu contributed to cleaner, more efficient code that is easier to maintain. Additionally, the case study demonstrated how the changes led to a more enjoyable user experience. Overall, refactoring was an essential step in enhancing the quality and usability of the Python banking system.
